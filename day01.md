# Day 1 – Working w/ an IDE and ES 2015

## Atom: Our IDE

## ES 2015

## Exercises!

## Homework! (sorry)

Because the wi-fi gets a little spotty at DHSI, I would ask you to download some software for tomorrow after class is over. We will be working with a Vue.js starter project template and it has a lot of dependencies to download. So, you will want to start that tonight (mostly because the wifi in the dorms will be faster than it is in our building).

In your command line, `cd` into your `Projects/` directory. Then, run the following two commands:

* `npm -g install vue-cli` – This command installs Vue's command-line interface.
* `vue init oncomouse/vue-template my-first-vue-app` – This will create a new Vue app in the directory `Projects/my-first-vue-app/`, but you can name the directory whatever you would like.
	* Answer the questions it asks you, but note the following:
	* If you do not have Google Chrome installed, make sure to anser "No" (`n`) to the question "Is Google Chrome Installed?".
	* Make sure to answer "No" (`n`) to the question "Install Vuex (state manager)?"
	* Choose "Yes, use NPM" to the question "Should we run `npm install` for you after the project has been created? (recommended)". This will take a while to finish, but you will be ready to go tomorrow.

Have a wonderful evening and see you tomorrow!
