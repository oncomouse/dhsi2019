# Welcome to The Frontend @ DHSI 2019

For this week, we will be learning about advanced JavaScript (specifically the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework) and CSS (using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Emotion.js](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)) in order to better understand how to make data-driven, responsive, and feature-rich applications using a modern software ecosystem.

Visit [Getting Started](getting-started.md) to learn about software you need to download.

See you in Victoria!
