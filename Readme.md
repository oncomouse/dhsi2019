# Welcome to The Frontend @ DHSI 2019

For this week, we will be learning about advanced JavaScript (specifically the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework) and CSS (using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Emotion.js](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)) in order to better understand how to make data-driven, responsive, and feature-rich applications using a modern software ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Open Visual Studio Code
	1. View Extensions (`View -> Extensions`)
	1. Search for "eslint" and install "ESLint" (should be the first result)

### Optional VS Code Extensions

1.  [VSCode React Refactor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=planbcoding.vscode-react-refactor)

See you in Victoria!
