## CSS Rules

1. Classes and IDs are lower-cased words separated by hyphens.
1. CSS Rules should be each on a new line, separated by commas.
1. CSS Selectors should be separated by 1 blank line.
1. All CSS Rules should have two elements; if not, refactor.

## BEM Rules

BEM stands for **B**lock, **E**lement, **M**odifier. It is a hierarchical, logical, and predictable way to name classes in CSS.

* **Blocks** are conceptual components on a page, such as `header`, `card`, or `navbar`.
	* Blocks are named in lowercase, with hyphens between words.
* **Elements** are smaller items contained in a Block, such as `header__title`, `card__image`, or `navbar__widget`.
	* Elements are named in lowercase, with the name of their parent block followed by two underscores, followed by the name of the element (which is in lowercase with hyphens between words).
* **Modifiers** represent special states applied to Blocks or Elements, such as `button--warning` or `navbar__widget--night-mode`.
	* Modifiers are applied in addition to the regular Block or Element identifier.
	* Modifiers are the name of the Block or Element followed by two hyphens, followed by the name of the modifier (which is, like everything else, written in lowercase with hyphens between words)

A couple of other rules for BEM:

* No element literals or IDs used in CSS; *everything* is addressed with classes.
	* This allows for reusability of CSS in case the underlying HTML has to change.
* Biggest challenge in BEM (and a source of debate amongst its users) is when an Element can instead by considered a Block.
	* Best advise is if you see yourself reusing the Element outside its associated Block, think about making it a B
	Block.

Sample BEM code:

~~~css
.form {
	margin: 1rem;
}

.form__formset {
	border: 1px solid #eee;
}

.form__input {
	border: 0;
	border-bottom: 1px solid #666;
}

.form__label {
	font-size: 0.9rem;
	padding-right: 0.5rem;
}

.form__submit {
	display: block;
	margin: auto;
}
~~~

And the HTML that uses it:

~~~html
<form class="form">
	<div class="form__formset">
		<label for="name" class="form__label">Enter Your Name:</label>
		<input type="text" class="form__input" name="name" />
	</div>
	<div class="form__formset">
		<label for="age" class="form__label">Enter Your Age:</label>
		<input type="number" class="form__input" name="age" />
	</div>
	<div class="form__formset">
		<button type="submit class="form__submit">Verify</button>
	</div>
</form>
~~~

### CSS and Namespacing

One problem with CSS is it's global namespace, which means that every class, ID, and element rule you define in your CSS is placed into the same global lexicon. If you define a rule for a BEM Block called `.button` for use in one part of your project and then some other developer comes along and defines a BEM Block called `.button` for their part of the project, these two rules will collide in the global namespace of CSS.

Large projects address this by writing generalizable CSS modules that are then used across a project or by writing more specifically named classes (often using some kind of scoping system). The important point is CSS can get very chaotic quickly and when working in a team, it's good to have a style guide or set of standards for naming worked out in advance.

### CSS Namespacing with Create React App

Create React App supports what are called [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). These load CSS as a JavaScript object instead of simply injecting a `<style>` tag into your document.

## Adding SASS to React

SASS stands for Syntactically Aware StyleSheets.

To add SASS support to CRA

## SASS Rules

1. Use variables for z-index scale, colors, fonts

## Styling React

## CSS Modules

## Emotion.js

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) is a CSS-in-JS framework, which lets us write CSS in JavaScript and use it directly with our React components. Instead of having a separate CSS file, the CSS lives right in the JS code.

For instance, here's a quick, pink button:

~~~ javascript
import styled, { css } from 'react-emotion'

const Button = styled('button')`
  color: hotpink;
`

render(<Button>This is a hotpink button.</Button>)
~~~

To install, run `npm install emotion react-emotion`.
